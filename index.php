      <p>
        The Gallery Cafe was born from a simple dream‚Äîa family‚Äôs love for food, art, and bringing people together.
        What began in our family kitchen with cherished recipes passed down through generations has grown into one of
        Colombo‚Äôs most beloved dining spots. Our founders, inspired by home-cooked warmth and hospitality, wanted to
        create a space where everyone feels at home.
      </p>
      <p>
        Every corner of the cafe tells a story‚Äîof shared meals, laughter, and the joy of good company. From traditional
        Sri Lankan flavors to international favorites, each dish is crafted with heart. Whether you're here for a quiet
        lunch or a special celebration, we welcome you as part of our family.
